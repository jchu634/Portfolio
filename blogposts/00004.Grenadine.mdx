#### Introduction
I wrote this otherwise I would forget it, this is literally just a recipe for some grenadine.
I don't know why you're reading this.

#### Ingredients
- 1 Volume of Pomegranate Juice
- 2 Volumes of Sugar
- Pomegranate molasses (optional)
- Orange blossom water (optional)

#### Instructions
1. Add the pomegranate juice and sugar to a saucepan
2. Heat on medium heat until the sugar is dissolved (mix as you go)
3. Once the sugar is dissolved, add the pomegranate molasses (Roughly a soup spoon per litre of juice)
4. Heat until low boil, then leave for a minute (This is for germ killing, though I have no idea if it is actually needed)
5. Add a couple splashes of orange blossom water
6. Let cool, then bottle.

#### Notes
- Since this is a rich syrup (2:1 Sugar to water), it should be shelf stable for who knows how long.
- The yield of the syrup is roughly equal to the amount of sugar. e.g. 2 cups sugar, 1 cup juice = 2 cups syrup.
