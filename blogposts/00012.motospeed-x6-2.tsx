          <h2>Intro</h2>
          After writing the first article, I got pretty nerdsniped into reverse
          engineering the rest of the mouse's features.
          <br />
          After finding the battery request in Part 1, it got much easier as I
          now know what to do and where to look.
          <br />
          Apologies about the relative dryness of the article, there isn't as
          much interesting insights about the info or the reverse engineering
          this time.
          <br />I promise the next part on Macros will be much more interesting.
        </div>
        <br />
        At its core, the API still sends SET_REPORTs with custom payloads to EP0
        to act as a private command, and it is pretty easy to reverse by just
        toggling stuff and seeing what in the payload changes.
        <br />
        Note: I assume that byte 2 in general acts as a command identifier,
        although it is pure conjecture, it lines up pretty well. (In this same
        vein, Lighting commands have an byte 3 additional sub-command
        identifier)
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h2>Lighting</h2>
          There are 4 lighting 'modes': (Nothing, Static, Breathing and
          Rainbow), byte 3 communicates the mode.
          <br /> Apart from that, there isn't particularly anything interesting
          to say about lighting packets, as the mode byte is followed by the
          brightness and speed bytes, and finally the RGB bytes and padding.
          <br />

          <h2>Settings</h2>
          The settings packets are in comparison quite a bit more interesting,
          they cram all the settings into one payload, and more importantly
          there are two unused bytes which appear before Esports mode,
          indicating there might be some hidden settings which are disabled if
          following convention.
          <br /> If I were to speculate, I would assume that they used to be
          used to set the debounce and sleep time, before they were spun out
          into their own packets, as the debounce and sleep packets are
          remarkably empty.
          <br />
          <h4>General Settings packet Example:</h4>
          Lift Up Distance = High, Ripple = on, Angle Snap = Off, Motion Sync =
          Off, Esports Mode = Closed

          <h3>Crammed Packets</h3>
          The DPI packet is quite remarkable in how much they managed to cram
          into one packet.
          <br />
          Motospeed uses the same packet to change DPI values, which DPI slot is
          currently being used and even how many DPI slots are active.
          <br /> Byte 4 changes the currently active slots, <br />
          Bytes 6-15 stores the DPI as sets of 16bit unsigned integers in
          little-endian format, <br />
          and finally byte 16 changes the number of active slots.
          <br />
          <h4>DPI packet Example:</h4>
          Currently selected DPI Slot: 4 (0-indexed), Slot 0 DPI: 400, Slot 1
          DPI: 800, Slot 2 DPI: 1200, Slot 3 DPI: 3200, Slot 4 DPI: 26000, DPI
          Count: 5
          <br />
          Notes: DPI is stored in little endian format. (e.g.
          <code>0x04b0</code> would be stored as <code>b0 04</code>)<br />
          Max DPI is 26000
          <br />

          <br />
          The dongle polling rate packet is extremely similar to the DPI packet,
          with the difference in that it has 1 index/slot more than DPI.
          <br />
          What may warrant further research is the fact that Motospeed does not
          expose the ability to change the polling rates.
          <br />I suspect things might start to either break, start doing
          interesting things, or quietly nothing changes if you change those
          values when sending to the mouse.
          <br /> I leave this as an exercise to the reader, as I don&apos;t want
          to break my one and only mouse.

          <h3>Additional Details</h3>
          The software saturation slider in the lighting controls is purely
          software based, all it does is change the RGB values in the command,
          it does not have its own byte. <br />
          Additionally, as an aside, the colour reproduction for the RGB is
          kinda crap, with a side-by-side for some colours, you wouldn't think
          they are supposed to be identical.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          Compared to part 1, I found this significantly easier to research as I
          learnt a lot during the process.
          <br />
          I find this stuff facinating, the amount of stuff they were able to
          achieve without custom drivers just by using SET_REPORT as a private
          channel to communicate configuration info.
          <br />
          Maybe one day I will write a virtual HID driver for controlling the
          RGB lights, of which I would argue hardly deserves that name, given
          how bad the colour reproduction is.
          <br />
          In part 3, I will explore how their button remapping feature works, so
          hopefully, I will see you then.
          <br />
